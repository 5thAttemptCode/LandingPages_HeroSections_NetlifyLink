                <p>The Carrera bodyshell was slightly wider on the rear wings than that on the 911 and 911 S. From model year 1984, Carrera models can be identified by the side indicator lights on the front wings. From model year 1984, the 911 Carrera was optionally available with a polyurethane (PU) front spoiler </p>

                <p>Safety, comfort and environmental friendliness increasingly took centre stage in the early 1970s and the "new 911s" rose to the challenge. The main feature was stronger bumpers that could withstand an impact of up to 8 km/h (almost 5 mph) without being permanently bent out of shape.</p>
