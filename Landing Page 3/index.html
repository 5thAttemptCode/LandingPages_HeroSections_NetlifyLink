                    The Air Jordan 3 was created in 1988, during a 
                    time of transition between the retro and the modern.

                The Fragment's resale value more than doubles its competition. 
                These shoes were both sold in limited releases, so why did Jordans 
                become so much more expensive? It all has to do with the value of 
                the Jordan brand and how it makes and markets its iconic sneakers.
                Alongside incorporating the same cool tone, the colorway features a 
                white tumbled leather construction and the iconic Elephant Print. 
                Affixed with a Jumpman Air logo along its heel, the Air Jordan 3 “Wizards” 
                is expected to release on April 29th.
