        <p>Haus Otto works in several fields ranging from industrial design, object and space and collaborates with clients from 
          industry and culture as well as on self-initiated projects. By bridging and blending different subjects and fields of 
          practice, Haus Otto conceptually explores the environmental and social context of design today and creates transformative 
          and humorous interventions. The studio was established by Patrick Henry Nagel and Nils Körner, who are both holding a 
          diploma in industrial design from the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, Germany. They have also studied at the 
          Alvar Aalto University in Helsinki and at the San José State University in California.</p>
